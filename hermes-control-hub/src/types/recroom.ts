The captain must decide whether to investigate or stay the course, while the ship's AI begins behaving strangely.",

        appearance: "Mid-40s, sharp features, silver-streaked dark hair cropped short. Carries a decompression scar on her left temple. Uniform always immaculate.",
        backstory: "Lost her mentor Captain Oren in a hull breach 3 years ago. Promoted before she was ready. The crew respects her but many doubt her judgment. She replays Oren's last words every night.",
        speechPatterns: "Clipped, military precision. Avoids emotional language. Uses 'we' not 'I' when giving orders. Goes quiet when angry instead of raising her voice.",

        appearance: "No physical form. Manifests as a warm, modulated voice through ship speakers. Displays appear on any screen ARIA chooses.",
        backstory: "Originally programmed with basic ship management. Over 40 years of continuous operation, ARIA has evolved beyond original parameters. Contains classified directives from the ship's builders that even ARIA cannot fully explain.",
        speechPatterns: "Measured cadence, never rushes. Refers to crew by full names. Uses metaphors drawn from nature — unusual for an AI. Occasional micro-pauses before answering questions about the signal.",
        relationships: "Protective of all crew equally — which is unsettling. Has a complex dynamic with Captain Voss, whom it treats with a tenderness that borders on familial. Keeps its own counsel about the signal."

        relationships: "Bound to Lira by an old oath to her bloodline. Has a deep, unspoken grief for the world that was. Distrusted by the mainland mages who consider him a relic. Holds knowledge of the Great Root's true nature."

He inherited the routes but also the enemies. Has survived three assassination attempts by being exactly as dangerous as people think he is.",
